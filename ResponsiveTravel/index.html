      <p>Florence is a city in central-northern Italy, and the capital of the Tuscany region.
      Florence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of that era.
      It is considered by many academics to have been the birthplace of the renaissance, and has been called "the
       Athens of the middle ages". The city is noted for its culture, renaissance art, and monuments.</p>

        <p>The Ponte Vecchio is a medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over the Arno River. It is noted for the shops built along it, as was once common. Butchers, tanners, and farmers initially occupied the shops; the present tenants are jewelers, art dealers, and souvenir sellers.</p>
